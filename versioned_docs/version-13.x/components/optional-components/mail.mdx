Apiato mails are just [Laravel Mails](https://laravel.com/docs/mail),
and they function in the exact same way as Laravel mails.
However, they come with additional rules and conventions specific to Apiato.

To generate new mails, you may use the `apiato:make:mail` interactive command:

```
php artisan apiato:make:mail
```

## Rules

- All container-specific Mails MUST be placed in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Mails` directory.
- All container-specific email templates MUST be placed in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Mails/Templates` directory.
- All general Mails MUST be placed in the `app/Ship/Mails` directory.
- All general email templates MUST be placed in the `app/Ship/Mails/Templates` directory.
- All Mails MUST extend the `App\Ship\Parents\Mails\Mail` class.
  - The parent extension SHOULD be aliased as `ParentMail`.
