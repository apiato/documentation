The `Apiato\Support\Facades\Response` facade is a powerful tool to create API responses.
It extends `Spatie\Fractal\Fractal` and enhances its functionality by
adding methods for resource key management, meta-information, and standardized HTTP responses.

Here are some examples of how to use the `Response` facade:

```php
Response::create($user)->transformWith(UserTransformer::class)->json(null, 200);
Response::create()->transformWith(UserTransformer::class)->ok($user);
Response::create($user, UserTransformer::class)->created();
Response::create($user, UserTransformer::class)->parseIncludes(['permissions'])->toArray();
Response::ok();
```

### Filtering {#filtering}
When using the `Response` facade, you can filter the response data using the `fields` query parameter.
This allows you to specify which fields you want to include in the response.

The `fields` query parameter is structured as follows:
```
fields[ResourceKey]=field1,field2
```
Where [ResourceKey](../components/main-components/models#resource-key) is the key of the resource you want to filter,
and `field1`, `field2` are the fields you want to include in the response.

Let's say we have an endpoint that returns a user resource with the following structure:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "User",
    "id": "0one37vjk49rp5ym",
    "email": "gandalf@the.grey",
    "products": {
      "data": [
        {
          "type": "Product",
          "id": "bmo7y84xpgeza06k",
          "status": "pending"
        },
        {
          "type": "Product",
          "id": "o0wzxbg0q4k7jp9d",
          "status": "fulfilled"
        }
      ]
    },
    "store": {
      "data": {
        "type": "Store",
        "id": "r6lbekg8rv5ozyad"
      }
    },
    "recipients": {
      "data": [
        {
          "type": "Recipient",
          "id": "r6lbekg8rv5ozyad",
          "contact": {
            "data": {
              "type": "Contact",
              "address": "123 Main St",
              "city": "Gotham"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If we specify the following query parameters in our request:
```
api.apiato.test/v1/users?fields[User]=type,email,products,recipients&fields[Product]=status&fields[Recipient]=id,contact&fields[Contact]=address,city
```

The response will be filtered to include only the specified fields:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "User",
    "email": "gandalf@the.grey",
    "products": {
      "data": [
        {
          "status": "pending"
        },
        {
          "status": "fulfilled"
        }
      ]
    },
    "recipients": {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "r6lbekg8rv5ozyad",
          "contact": {
            "address": "123 Main St",
            "city": "Gotham"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration
You can configure the filter settings in the `config/fractal.php` file.
```php
'auto_fieldsets' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'request_key' => 'fields',
],
```

## Response Macros
If you would like to define a custom response that you can re-use in a variety of your routes and controllers,
you may use the `macro` method on the `Response` facade.
Typically,
you should call this method from the boot method of one of your application's [service providers](../components/optional-components/service-providers.mdx),
such as the `App\Ship\Providers\ShipServiceProvider` service provider:

```php
use Apiato\Support\Facades\Response;
use App\Ship\Parents\Providers\ServiceProvider as ParentServiceProvider;

class ShipServiceProvider extends ParentServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Response::macro('caps', function (string $value) {
            return Response::make(strtoupper($value));
        });
    }
}
```
