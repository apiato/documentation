In the Container layer of [Porto](porto.md#container),
you will find a comprehensive range of [predefined Components](https://github.com/Mahmoudz/Porto#components),
each with its specific responsibility.
It is imperative to organize all your code within these Components to ensure proper structure and organization.

Apiato offers an [extensive list](../components/index.md) of these Components,
accompanied by detailed guidelines for their utilization.
Adhering to these guidelines is crucial to ensure a streamlined development process.

Components play a pivotal role in maintaining consistency throughout your codebase and enhancing its maintainability.
They provide a clear and structured approach, making it easier to locate and manage individual code snippets.

Leveraging these Components enables you to construct a modular and reusable codebase,
simplifying future maintenance and facilitating modifications when needed.

Components in Porto are categorized into two types: Main Components and Optional Components.

## Main Components {#main-components}
[Main Components](../components/main-components/index.md) are essential for the Container's functionality and must be used to achieve its core purpose.

## Optional Components {#optional-components}
[Optional Components](../components/optional-components/index.md) offer additional functionality
that can be incorporated into the Container.
Their usage is discretionary, depending on specific requirements.
