title: Default Endpoints
---

Apiato comes loaded with many useful API endpoints for speeding up the development process.

You can see the endpoints in three ways:
- In Terminal, by running `php artisan route:list -c`.
- In Browser, by generating the beautiful detailed documentation. See [API Docs Generator](../additional-features/apiato-containers/documentation).
- In Code, by navigating to the `Routes` folder of each container's UI.
