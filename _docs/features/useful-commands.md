## List All Actions Command

It's useful to be able to see all the implemented use cases in your application. To do so type
`php artisan apiato:list:actions`

You can also pass `--withfilename` flag to see all Actions with the files names.  
`apiato:list:actions --withfilename`

## List All Tasks Command

It's useful to be able to see all the implemented tasks in your application. To do so type
`php artisan apiato:list:tasks`

You can also pass `--withfilename` flag to see all Tasks with the files names.

## List Container Dependencies Command

Sometimes it is required to show dependencies between containers (e.g., how they are _interlinked_ amongst each others). 
Apiato provides a command to list all dependencies for one specific container. The command does take the `Apiato::call()` and `$this->call()` (with `use X`) into account.

If you want to get the dependencies for one container, you can call 

```bash
php artisan apiato:list:dependencies app/Containers/X
```

where `X` is the name of the requested container (e.g., `User`).
