## Form content types (W3C)

By default Apiato is configured to encode simple text/ASCII data `x-www-form-urlencoded`. However, it does support 
other types as well. 

#### ASCII payload

To tell the web server that you are posting simple text/ASCII payload (`name=Mahmoud+Zalt&age=18`), you need to include 
`Content-Type : x-www-form-urlencoded` in the request header.

#### JSON payload

To tell the web server that you are posting JSON-formatted payload (`{name : 'Mahmoud Zalt', age: 18}`), you need to 
include `Content-Type = application/json` in the request header.

*(you may wish return Json data in this case as well, you can do so by changing the response serializer from 
`DataArraySerializer` to `JsonApiSerializer`, more about that in the response page).*

## HTTP Request Headers

| Header        | Value Sample                        | When to send it                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accept        | `application/json`                  | MUST be sent with every endpoint.                                            |
| Content-Type  | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | MUST be sent when passing Data.                                              |
| Authorization | `Bearer {Access-Token-Here}`        | MUST be sent whenever the endpoint requires (Authenticated User).            |
| If-None-Match | `811b22676b6a4a0489c920073c0df914`  | MAY be sent to indicate a specific **ETag** of an prior Request to this Endpoint. If both ETags match (i.e., are the same) a HTTP 304 (not modified) is returned. |


> #### Heads Up!
> 
> Normally you should include the `Accept : application/json` HTTP header when you call a JSON API. However, in Apiato 
> you can force your users to send `application/json` by setting `'force-accept-header' => true,` in 
> `app/Ship/Configs/apiato.php` or allow them to skip it completely by setting the `'force-accept-header' => false,`. 
> By default this flag is set to false.

## Calling Endpoints

<a name="call-unprotected-EP"></a>
### Calling unprotected endpoint example:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; -F "email=admin@admin.com" -F "password=admin" -F "=" "http://api.domain.develop/v2/register"
```

<a name="call-protected-EP"></a>
### Calling protected endpoint (passing Bearer Token) example:

```shell
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." -H "http://api.domain.develop/v1/users"
```
