## Containers

apiato ships with a few pre-defined and pre-configured containers. However, other developers may provide additional
features in form of a respective container. This section explains, how so called `3rd party containers` may be
automatically downloaded and installed to your specific web application.

**Note that this feature is only available for apiato > 4.1.3**

### Downloading and Installing 3rd Party Containers

In order to use a specific container that is developed by a 3rd party developer, apiato provides an easy-to-use solution 
for downloading, installing and continuously updating containers from 3rd party developers.

As an application developer, you simply need to include the respective `vendor/project` to the
`composer.json` file within the `app/Containers` folder.

For example, the respective `/app/Containers/composer.json` file may look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "apiato/containers",
  "description": "Composer file to include 3rd party containers.",
  "require": {
    "johannesschobel/apiato-null" : "dev-master"
  }
}

```

You just need to call `composer update` in order to install the respective packages. The package (e.g., the container)
`johannesschobel/apiato-null` is then installed to the `/app/Container` folder. However, the developer of the package
needs to follow some basic guidelines listed below.

> Warning: **Do not** modify content within a downloaded container, as it will be overwritten if you call `composer update`.

### Developing a Container

Developing a container that can be used by others is quite easy. Basically, you can `extract` already existing functionality
in a new container and provide the features. Note that you need to upload the container to `GitHub` and then release
it on `Packagist` in order to be available via `Composer`. Please see a respective tutorial how to submit a package
to `GitHub` and release it via `Packagist`.

In particular, the only thing that needs to be done, when developing a container, is to provide a specific `composer.json` 
file within the main folder of the container.

An example of such a `composer.json` file is shown below:

```
{
  "name": "vendor/project",
  "description": "This is a short description for your container.",
  "type": "apiato-container",   // you must set the type to "apiato-container" here!
  "require": {
    "somevendor/somepackage" : "dev-master"
    // some other requirements here
  },
  "extra": {
    "apiato": {
      "container": {
        "name": "Foo"   // The name of the container within the /app/Containers folder
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Information:**
* You **must** add the respective `type : apiato-container` to the composer file. This way, the custom installer is used
that allows installing / updating containers.
* You **must** provide the key `extra.apiato.container.name`. This key indicates the name of the folder (e.g., container)
when installing the package to the `/app/Containers` folder. In the shown example, the container would be installed to
`app/Containers/Foo`.
