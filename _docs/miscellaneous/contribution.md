# Standards and Practices


<a name="Versioning"></a>
### Versioning

The project is versioned under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.


<a name="Coding-Standards"></a>
### Coding Standards

The project is compliant with [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) Coding Standard,
[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) Coding Style and some of the
[PSR-12](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/extended-coding-style-guide.md) Styles.
 
As well as it is compliant with [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) Autoloader.
*If you notice any compliance oversights, you can send a patch via pull request.*


<a name="Git-Branches"></a>
### Git Branches

The `master` branch contains the upcoming Apiato release (in both repositories `apiato/apiato` and `apiato/core`). While the other branches are for the stable releases.

Bug fixes should be sent to the latest stable branch, never to the `master` branch, unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.

Major new features should always be sent to the `master` branch, which contains the upcoming release.

**Example:**

Say we are in version `7.0` right now. The repository would have at least the following two branches `master` and `7.0` (possibly older branches as well such as `5.1`, `5.0`, `4.2`, `4.1`, `4.0` and so on). The latest stable branch in this case would be the `7.0`. The next release will be `7.1` or `8.0`.

If your PR contains a major change or a braking change, or new Container than it must be sent to the `master` branch. And if your PR fixes a bug, then it should be sent to the latest release branch.

> If you would like to always contribute to Apiato, it's better to use the master branch instead of the latest release branch, to always have the latest features and updates.

<a name="Proposing-Feature"></a>
### Proposing Feature

If you have a proposal or a feature request, you may create an issue with `[Feature]` tag in the title, example `[Feature] Support XML responses`.

The proposal should also describe the new feature, as well as implementation ideas.
The proposal will then be reviewed and either approved or denied.
Once a proposal is approved, a pull request may be created implementing the new feature.


<a name="Reporting-Bugs"></a>
### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked in our project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/issues).

When submitting a bug report, please include enough information to reproduce the bug.

A good bug report includes the following sections:

* Expected outcome
* Actual outcome
* Steps to reproduce, including sample code
* Any other information that will help us debug and reproduce the issue, including stack traces, system/environment information, and screenshots


<a name="Fixing-Bugs"></a>
### Fixing Bugs

If you see a bug report that you'd like to fix,
please feel free to do so.
Following the directions and guidelines described in the "Adding New Features" section below, you may create bugfix branches and send us pull requests.


<a name="Adding-New-Features"></a>

### Adding New Features

If you have an idea for a new feature, 
it's a good idea to check out our [issues](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/issues) or active [pull requests](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/pulls) first 
to see if the feature is already being worked on. 
If not, feel free to submit an issue first, asking whether the feature is beneficial to the project. 
This will save you from doing a lot of development work only to have your feature rejected.



<a name="Contribution-Guidelines"></a>
### Contribution Guidelines
Important things to remember when contributing:

* **Run tests first** Before writing any line of code, run the tests `vendor/bin/phpunit`, and make sure all the tests are passing in your machine.
* **Use topic/feature branches** Be descriptive in your branch names, (same apply to pull request title and descriptions).
* **Keep your commits atomic** each commit should represent a single unit of change. (Also, remember to write helpful commit messages.)
* **Send coherent history** make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
* **Write tests** (classes or functions) as required. Your changes must be covered with Tests (Functional or Unit). (Code without tests could be accepted in some cases).
* **Ensure that tests pass** before submitting your pull request. We have Travis CI automatically running tests for pull requests. However, running the tests locally `vendor/bin/phpunit` after adding your changes will save you time.
* **Update the Documentation** `github.com/apiato/documentation/tree/master/_docs`. 
* **Update the CHANGELOG** `CHANGELOG.md`.
* **Submit one feature/change per pull request.** If you have multiple features/changes you wish to submit, please break them up into separate pull requests.
* **Push additional changes to the same PR** once you have a pull request for a branch, you can push additional changes to the same branch and they will be added to the pull request automatically. You should not create a new pull request for the same branch.
* **Comment on the pull request** when you want people to know that you have pushed new changes. Although GitHub does notify people of commit pushes, people are more likely notice your changes if you leave a comment.

# Contributing to Apiato

> The project consist of 2 repositories `apiato/apiato` (the project skeleton, with default containers) and `apiato/core` (the core package of apiato).


<a name="Contributing-Skeleton-Project"></a>
## Contributing to the Skeleton Project

The Apiato skeleton, is the actual Apiato project on the repository `apiato/apiato`.

This guide will help you contribute to the Apiato skeleton project, while working on your personal project. 

If you added a feature/function to your local project or created a useful container or fixed a bug. This guide will show you how to submit that change to Apiato.


### SETUP

**One time setup**

In this scenario let's assume we have the following:

* `Apiato`     # is the starter/framework project
* `Project-A`  # your personal project your building on top of apiato


1) Create Project A from Apiato

If you want to fix a bug on the latest stable release your PR should be sent to the latest stable branch, thus you need to pull the latest stable release of Apiato.

`composer create-project apiato/apiato project-a`

If you want to add new features or do anything else, that should be added to the next stable release, you need to pull the master branch and submit your PR there.   

`composer create-project apiato/apiato project-a dev-master`

2) Initialize git in Project A

`git init`

3.a) Setup your origin remote (to point to your project private repository url)

`git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:username/repo.git`

*if you already have origin remote then update it with*

`git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket.org:username/project-a.git`


3.b) Setup an upstream remote (to point to your fork of the apiato repository)

*assuming you already forked the repository*

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:username/apiato.git`

Now you should have the following remotes:

```
❯ git remote -vv
origin      git@bitbucket.org:username/project-a.git (fetch)
origin      git@bitbucket.org:username/project-a.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:username/apiato.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:username/apiato.git (push)
```

4) Do your first commit

`git add . && git commit -m 'first commit'`

5.a) Create apiato branch

`git checkout -b apiato`

5.b) Let the apiato branch track the upstream master branch

`git checkout apiato`

`git branch --set-upstream-to upstream/master`

Now you should have the following branches:

```
❯ git branch -vv
 apiato           77b4d945 [upstream/master] ...
 master           77d302aa [origin/master] ...
```

### USAGE (Contribution Steps)

**Must do every time before you contribute**

1) Update remotes (fetch)

`git fetch --all`

2) Go to the apiato branch 

`git checkout apiato`

3) Sync apiato branch with upstream/master

`git reset --hard upstream/master`

4) Now you can cherry pick the commits you'd like to contribute 

4.a) First go to the apiato branch

`git checkout apiato` 

4.b) Create custom branch for your PR

`git checkout -b feature-awesome`  (must be created from apiato)   

4.c) Do the cherry-picking

`git log master`      (copy the commit ID)

`git cherry-pick {commit-ID}`

*(repeat for all commits you want to submit)*

5) Push apiato branch to the upstream

`git push upstream feature-awesome`   (replace feature-awesome with your custom branch name)

6) Create a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repository to the apiato official repository.

Make sure you create a PR from your custom branch `feature-awesome` to `master` (or the latest stable release).

*W'll do our best to merge your PR in the shortest time possible. Thanks in advanced :)*

<a name="Contributing-Core-Package"></a>
## Contributing to the Core Package

The Apiato core package, is what provides most of the functionality of the Apiato project. 

This guide will help you contribute to the Apiato core package, while the package is in your vendor directory. Without much effort.


### SETUP

1) Delete the `core` package `vendor/apiato/core` from the vendor directory.

2) Pull the package to the project vendor (even if it was there) using:

`composer update {your-username}/core --prefer-source`

_The composer option `--prefer-source` will clone the package's git repository inside the vendor directory, so you can commit and push from the vendor directory directly._

3) Go to `vendor/apiato/core/` from the terminal to access the package Git, in order to commit.

You should now have the `.git` directory of the `core` package (your forked version).

### USAGE (Contribution Steps)

<a name="Contributing-Documentation"></a>
## Contributing to the Documentation

The documentation is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and lives in the [documentation repository (apiato/documentation)](https://github.com/apiato/documentation), in the `_docs/` folder. 

All you have to do is navigate to `_docs/` folder, find the markdown `.md` file that you want to update *(all files are named as they are in the site menu)*, update or add the text, the commit.

> You do not need to build the site locally. Just edit the markdown files and submit your PR. GitHub will build the site for us. 

### Documentation Tips:

- The styles are in `main.scss` and `_sass/*`.
- The Layout `_layouts/default.html`.
- The docs folders `_docs/*` do not represent the categories displayed in the site. 
- To add new category for a file `category: "New Category"` (usually defined in each documentation readme).
you must add the category name to `_config.yml` under `categories-order` in order to appear in the site. 
- To set a link, use the internal links as follow: `[your-text]( { { site.baseurl } } { % link _docs/path/file.md % } )`. NOTE: remove the spaces between the tags.

### Run the docs locally: 

#### In Docker:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apiato/documentation .`
2. `docker run -v $PWD:/srv/jekyll -p 4000:4000 -it jekyll/jekyll bash` 
3. `bundle install`
4. `jekyll serve`
5. Browse `http://localhost:4000`

#### Natively:

1. Install (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/] and its dependencies.
2. `git clone https://github.com/apiato/documentation .`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Browse `http://localhost:4000`
6. Finally `jekyll build`

<a name="Contributing-Generator"></a>
## Contributing to the Code Generator

The Code generator is part of the `apiato/core` package.

- Repository: `apiato/core`.
- Code Path: `/Generator`.

Each component command, "Except the Containers Generator" must extend from the `Apiato\Core\Generator\GeneratorCommand.php`.

This abstract class does all the work for you.

### Add new component generator.

General Info: the only function that gets called whenever a command is executed is the `handle()` function. 
This function exist on the abstract class `Apiato\Core\Generator\GeneratorCommand` which does all the common job for all the generator commands.
For better understanding of how things work. Make sure you read that function.    

1 - Add create new command by copy pasting any of the existing components commands already supported. The `Generator/Commands/RouteGenerator.php` is a great example.

For each generator you need to implement exactly one method (as it is defined in the respective interface)

- `getUserInputs:` 
    This method reads all parameters from the command line or provides a wizard to get information from the user.
    The available options for this generator are specified using the `public $inputs = []` variable in respective generator.
    Note that you do not need to specify the options for `--container` or `--file`, as both are handled directly by the 
    Generator itself. Simply add the options that are specifically needed for this generator.
    
    Be sure to read input with the `checkParameterOrXYZ()` methods, as they automatically check if an option is available. 
    Otherwise, they will ask the user for additional input.
    
    The method must return an array of 3 keys:
  - `path-parameters` are used to replace variables within the path where the generator creates the file.
  - `file-parameters` are used to replace variables within the name of the file to be created.
  - `stub-parameters` are used to replace variables within the stub.
  

2 - Create the stub to be loaded in `Generator/Stubs`, copy any real component code and build the stub out of it.

3 - Finally register the command in `Generator/GeneratorsServiceProvider.php` using `registerGenerators`, example:

```php
        $this->registerGenerators([
            ActionGenerator::class,
            RouteGenerator::class,
            TaskGenerator::class,
            // ...
        ]);
```

4 - Default FileName & FileExtension(optional)

You may provide another default filename or extension by overriding the `getDefaultFileName()` or `getDefaultFileExtension()` 
method, which simply returns a `string`.
