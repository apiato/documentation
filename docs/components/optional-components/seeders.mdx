Apiato seeders are just [Laravel Seeders](https://laravel.com/docs/seeding),
and they function in the exact same way as Laravel seeders.
However, they come with additional rules and conventions specific to Apiato.

To generate new seeders, you may use the `apiato:make:seeder` interactive command:

```
php artisan apiato:make:seeder
```

## Rules

- All container-specific Seeders MUST be placed in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Data/Seeders` directory.
- All Seeders MUST extend the `App\Ship\Parents\Seeders\Seeder` class.

## Folder Structure

```markdown
app
└── Containers
    └── Section
        └── Container
            └── Data
                └── Seeders
                    ├── DemoSeeder_1.php
                    ├── AnotherDemoSeeder_2.php
                    └── ...
```

## Code Example

Seeders are defined exactly as you would define them in Laravel.

#### Prepend Section Name

In situations where two seeder classes have the same name but exist in different containers,
manually prepend the seeder name with the section name to distinguish them.

## Loading Order

Apiato enables the loading of seeders in a specific order.
To organize the seeding of classes, simply add `_1`, `_2`, and so on, to your class names.
For instance, `UserPermissionsSeeder_1` will be loaded before `UserPermissionsSeeder_2`.

### Configuration
Apiato is configured to load all seeder files in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Data/Seeders` directory.

If the default configuration does not suit your needs, you can customize it
via the [Apiato Configuration](../../framework-features/advance-configuration.mdx#seeders) class.
