Apiato factories are just [Laravel Factories](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-factories),
and they function in the exact same way as Laravel factories.
However, they come with additional rules and conventions specific to Apiato.

To generate new factories, you may use the `apiato:make:factory` interactive command:

```
php artisan apiato:make:factory
```

## Rules

- Factory name MUST be the same as its corresponding model name and suffixed with `Factory`.
- All Factories:
  - MUST be placed in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Data/Factories` directory.
  - MUST extend the `App\Ship\Parents\Factories\Factory` class.
    - The parent extension SHOULD be aliased as `ParentFactory`.

## Folder Structure

```markdown
app
└── Containers
    └── Section
        └── Container
            └── Data
                └── Factories
                    ├── ModelFactory.php
                    └── ...
```

## Code Example

Factories are defined exactly as you would define them in Laravel.

## Model and Factory Discovery

When you use a factory, Laravel relies on conventions to determine the appropriate factory for the model.
By default,
Laravel will search for a factory in the `Database\Factories` namespace
that has a class name matching the model name and is suffixed with `Factory`.

However, in the case of Apiato, factories are distributed across the Containers,
and they are not all within the same namespace.
As a result, Apiato follows a different convention to locate the appropriate factory for a model.

Apiato will look for factories in `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Data/Factories` directories
that has a class name matching the model name and is suffixed with `Factory`.

If these conventions do not apply to your particular application, you may configure the factory discovery
via the [Apiato Configuration](../../framework-features/advance-configuration.mdx#factories) class.

:::note Custom Models
Apiato factory discovery feature depends on some features available in Apiato models.
If your model does not extend the `App\Ship\Parents\Models\Model` or the `App\Ship\Parents\Models\UserModel` class,
refer to the [Custom Models](../../components/main-components/models/#custom-models) section for more information.
