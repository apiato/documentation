import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Optional Components offer additional functionality
that can be incorporated into the Container.
Their usage is discretionary, depending on specific requirements.

Most of these components are just Laravel components,
and they function in the exact same way as Laravel components.
However, they come with additional rules and conventions specific to the Apiato.
