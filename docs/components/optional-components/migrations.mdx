Apiato migrations are just [Laravel Migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations),
and they function in the exact same way as Laravel migrations.
However, they come with additional rules and conventions specific to Apiato.

To generate new migrations, you may use the `apiato:make:migration` interactive command:

```
php artisan apiato:make:migration
```

## Rules

- All container-specific Migrations MUST be placed in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Data/Migrations` directory.
- All general Migrations MUST be placed in the `app/Ship/Migrations` directory.

## Folder Structure

```markdown
app
├── Containers
│   └── Section
│       └── Container
│           └── Data
│               └── Migrations
│                   ├── 0000_01_01_000001_create_things_table.php
│                   └── ...
└── Ship
    └── Migrations
        ├── 0000_02_02_000002_create_another_things_table.php
        └── ...
```

## Code Example

Migrations are defined exactly as you would define them in Laravel.

## Configuration
Apiato is configured
to load all migration files in the `app/Containers/{Section}/{Container}/Data/Migrations` and `app/Ship/Migrations` directories.

If the default configuration does not suit your needs, you can customize it
via the [Apiato Configuration](../../digging-deeper/advance-configuration.mdx#migrations) class.
