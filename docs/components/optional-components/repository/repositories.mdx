Apiato provides a powerful repository pattern implementation based on the [L5 Repository](https://github.com/andersao/l5-repository) package.

> To prevent overlap with the L5 Repository documentation, this page
> exclusively delves into Apiato distinct features and configurations,
> offering only a limited set of examples.
> To learn more about the L5 Repository package,
> please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/andersao/l5-repository).

Repositories play a crucial role in software architecture
by separating and abstracting the data layer from the business logic.
They serve as an essential architectural pattern to promote code separation,
flexibility, and maintainability in software development.
Repositories help
create clean and organized codebases
by abstracting the intricacies of data access and manipulation from the core business logic.

To generate new repositories,
you may use the `apiato:make:repository` interactive command:

```
php artisan apiato:make:repository
```

You can also generate a model and its repository at the same time by using the `apiato:make:model` interactive command:

```
php artisan apiato:make:model
```

## Rules

- All Repositories:
  - MUST be placed in the `app/Containers/{section}/{container}/Data/Repositories` directory.
  - MUST extend the `App\Ship\Parents\Repositories\Repository` class.
    - The parent extension SHOULD be aliased as `ParentRepository`.
  - SHOULD be named after the model they are associated with, followed by the `Repository` suffix. For instance, `UserRepository.php`.
- A Model MUST always get accessed through its Repository.
- Every Model MUST have a Repository.

## Folder Structure

```markdown
app
└── Containers
    └── Section
        └── Container
            └── Data
                └── Repositories
                    ├── UserRepository.php
                    └── ...
```

## Code Example
```php
use App\Ship\Parents\Repositories\Repository as ParentRepository;

class UserRepository extends ParentRepository
{
    protected $fieldSearchable = [
        'id' => '=',
        'name' => 'like',
        'email' => '=',
        'email_verified_at' => '=',
        'created_at' => '=',
    ];
}
```

## Configuration
All the configuration options for this feature are located in the `app/Ship/Configs/repository.php` config file.

## Binding Models
Once you have created a repository, you need to associate it with its corresponding model.
You can either let Apiato automatically discover the model or manually bind the model to the repository.

### Model Discovery
By default,
Apiato automatically discovers and associates your repositories with their corresponding models as long
as the model and repository follow standard Apiato naming [conventions](#rules).

However, if these conventions do not apply to your particular application, you may configure the model discovery logic
via the [Apiato Configuration](../../../digging-deeper/advance-configuration.mdx#repositories) class.

### Manual Model Binding
If you prefer to manually bind the model to the repository,
you can do so by implementing the `model` method in your repository class.
This method should return the fully qualified class name of the model.

```php
use App\Ship\Parents\Repositories\Repository as ParentRepository;

class DemoRepository extends ParentRepository
{
    public function model(): string
    {
        return AnotherDemo::class;
    }
}
```

## Pagination {#pagination}

Pagination is automatically applied when you use the `paginate` method with a model repository:

```php
{
    $this->userRepository->paginate();
}
```

To move between pages of results, you can use the `page` query parameter like this:

```
api.apiato.test/v1/users?page=200
```

You can use the `page` parameter in any `GET` request that lists records.

Whenever a request returns paginated results,
you'll find information about the pagination in the **meta** section of the response,
which tells you things like the total number of records, the number on the current page, and more.

```
"data": [...],
"meta": {
    "pagination": {
        "total": 2000,
        "count": 30,
        "per_page": 10,
        "current_page": 20,
        "total_pages": 200,
        "links": []
    }
}
```

### Limiting Results Per Page

You can control the number of results displayed on a single page using the `limit` parameter.

By default, the pagination limit is set to 10.
If you don't specify the `?limit=` parameter in your request, the response will contain 10 records per page.

You can adjust the default pagination limit in the `.env` file:

```dotenv
PAGINATION_LIMIT_DEFAULT=10
```

For instance, if you want to receive 100 resources per page, add the `?limit=100` query parameter to your request:

```
api.apiato.test/v1/users?limit=100
```

This will return 100 resources within a single page of results.
You can also combine the `limit` and `page` query parameters to access the next 100 resources:

```
api.apiato.test/v1/users?limit=100&page=2
```

### Maximum Pagination Limit

You can also set the maximum number of resources
that can be returned in a single page by setting the `$maxPaginationLimit` property in your repository class.

For example, to set the maximum number of resources to 20, you can do the following:
```php
protected $maxPaginationLimit = 20;
```

### Disabling Pagination

You can allow clients to request all data that matches their criteria and disable pagination,
which can be applied either project-wide or on a per-repository basis.
This enables a request to retrieve all matching data by specifying `limit=0`.

To retrieve all matching entities in a single page, you can use the following query parameter:

```
api.apiato.test/v1/users?limit=0
```

#### Project-Wide
To allow disabling pagination for the entire project, set `PAGINATION_SKIP=true` in the `.env` file.

#### Per Repository
If you wish to allow disabling pagination for a specific repository,
set the `$allowDisablePagination` property in your repository class.

:::note
Per-repository configurations take precedence and override the global settings.
:::

## RequestCriteria
RequestCriteria is a standard Criteria implementation
that enables filters to be applied to the repository based on parameters sent in the request.
It allows for dynamic searches, data filtering, and query customization.

To use RequestCriteria, you need to apply it to the repository.
Apiato provides two methods, `addRequestCriteria` and `removeRequestCriteria`, which are available on all repositories.

Here's an example of how to use RequestCriteria:

```php
use App\Containers\AppSection\User\Data\Repositories\UserRepository;
use App\Ship\Parents\Tasks\Task as ParentTask;

class ListUsersTask extends ParentTask
{
    public function __construct(
        protected readonly UserRepository $repository
    ) {
    }

    public function run(): mixed
    {
        // $this->repository->removeRequestCriteria();
        return $this->repository->addRequestCriteria()->paginate();
    }
}
```

It's important to note
that using the `removeRequestCriteria` method is only relevant if you have previously applied `RequestCriteria`.
If it hasn't been applied, there is no need to remove it,
as RequestCriteria is not automatically applied unless explicitly used.

### Sorting and Ordering

You can use the `orderBy` and `sortedBy` parameters to sort the data in the response.

The `sortedBy` parameter is typically employed in conjunction with the `orderBy` parameter.

By default, the `orderBy` parameter sorts the data in **Ascending** order.
To sort the data in **Descending** order, you can include `sortedBy=desc`.

For example:

```
?orderBy=id&sortedBy=asc
```

```
?orderBy=created_at&sortedBy=desc
?orderBy=name&sortedBy=asc
```

You can use the following values for the `sortedBy` parameter:

- `asc` for Ascending.
- `desc` for Descending.

### Searching

> There is much more to searching than what is covered here.
> Please refer to the [L5 Repository documentation](https://github.com/andersao/l5-repository) for more details.

When the RequestCriteria is enabled for a specific route,
you can use the `search` parameter in `GET` HTTP requests on that route to perform searches.

To make the search feature work, you need to specify which fields from the model should be searchable.
In your repository,
set the `fieldSearchable` field with the names of the fields
you want to make searchable or specify a relation to the fields.

Here's an example:

```php
protected $fieldSearchable = [
    'name',
    'email',
    'product.name'
];
```

You can also set the type of condition that will be used to perform the query. The default condition is "=":

```php
protected $fieldSearchable = [
    'name' => 'like',
    'email', // Default Condition "="
    'your_field' => 'condition'
];
```

You can use the `search` parameter in various ways:

```
?search=John
?search=name:John
?search=name:John%20Doe
```

> Replace spaces with `%20` in the URL (e.g., `search=keyword%20here`).

#### Searching with Hashed IDs

If you have [Hash ID](../../../security/hash-id.mdx) enabled and want to search a hashed field,
like a user ID, you need to instruct the `RequestCriteria` to decode it before performing the search.

For example,
if you have a search query like this:
```
?search=id:XbPW7awNkzl83LD6;parent_id:aYOxlpzRMwrX3gD7;some_hashed_id:NxOpZowo9GmjKqdR
```
You should update your `addRequestCriteria` method as follows:

```php
$this->repository->addRequestCriteria(['id', 'parent_id', 'some_hashed_id'])->all();
```

## Caching

L5 Repository supports caching of queries.
This feature is `disabled` by default.
You can enable caching in the `app/Ship/Configs/repository.php` config or the `.env` file.

```php
'cache' => [
    'enabled' => true,
],
```

```dotenv
ELOQUENT_QUERY_CACHE=true
```

:::note
As per the L5 Repository documentation,
you need to implement the `CacheableRepository` interface
and use the `CacheableRepositoryTrait` trait in your repository class to enable caching.
However, Apiato already implements these two requirements in the parent `Repository` class,
:::

### Skipping Cache

You can skip the cache for a specific request by adding the `?skipCache=true` query parameter to the request URL.

```
?skipCache=true
```

> It's not recommended to skip the cache, but it's useful for testing purposes.

## Eager Loading Includes {#eager-loading}
By default,
Apiato automatically eager-loads the relationships
specified by the [include](../../main-components/transformers.mdx#include-relationships) query parameter.
This preloads the requested related data to optimize performance.

You can disable this feature by overriding the `shouldEagerLoadIncludes` method in your repository class.
```php
public function shouldEagerLoadIncludes(): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

:::note
Apiato does not automatically eager-load the [default includes](../../main-components/transformers.mdx#include-by-default).
