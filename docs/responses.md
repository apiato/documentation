### Apiato Response {#response}

In Apiato you can define your own response payload or use one of the supported serializers.

Currently, the supported serializers are (`ArraySerializer`, `DataArraySerializer` and `JsonApiSerializer`). As provided
by [Fractal](https://fractal.thephpleague.com/transformers/).

By default, Apiato uses `DataArraySerializer`. Below is an example of the response payload.

### Default Apiato Responses Payload: {#default-response-payload}

`DataArraySerializer` response payload looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 100,
      ...
      "relation 1": {
        "data": [ // multiple data
          {
            "id": 11,
			  ...
          }
        ]
      },
      "relation 2": {
        "data": { // single data
          "id": 22,
          ...
          }
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  "meta": {
    "include": [ // what can be included
      "xxx",
      "yyy"
    ],
    "custom": [],
    "pagination": {
      "total": 999,
      "count": 999,
      "per_page": 999,
      "current_page": 999,
      "total_pages": 999,
      "links": {
        "next": "https://api.apiato.test/v1/accounts?page=999"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Paginated response:**

When data is paginated the response payload will contain a `meta` description about the pagination.

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "include": [
      "xxx",
      "yyy"
    ],
    "custom": [],
    "pagination": { // pagination meta
      "total": 999,
      "count": 999,
      "per_page": 999,
      "current_page": 999,
      "total_pages": 999,
      "links": {
        "next": "https://api.apiato.test/v1/accounts?page=999"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Includes:**

Informs the User about what relationships can be included in the response. Example: `?include=tags,user`

For more details read the `Relationships` section in the [Query Parameters](core-features/query-parameters#relationships-include) page.

### Change the default Response payload: {#change-default-response-payload}

The default response format (specification) is the `DataArray` Fractal Serializer (`League\Fractal\Serializer\DataArraySerializer`).

To change the default Fractal Serializer open the `app/Ship/Configs/fractal.php` file and change the

```text
'default_serializer' => League\Fractal\Serializer\DataArraySerializer::class,
```

The Supported Serializers are
* `ArraySerializer`
* `DataArraySerializer`
* `JsonApiSerializer`

More details can be found at [Fractal](https://fractal.thephpleague.com/transformers/) and
[Laravel Fractal Wrapper](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-fractal).

In case of returning JSON Data (`JsonApiSerializer`), you may wish to check some JSON response standards:

* [JSEND](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend) (very basic)
* [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/format/) (very popular and well documented)
* [HAL](https://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) (useful in case of hypermedia)

### Resource Keys {#resource-keys}

The transformer allows appending a `ResourceKey` to the transformed resource. You can set the `ResourceKey` in your
response payload in 2 ways:

1. Manually set it via the respective parameter in the `Controller::transform` method.
   Note that this will only set the
`top level` resource key and does not affect the resource keys from `included` resources!
2. Specify it on the respective `Model`. By overriding $resourceKey, (`protected $resourceKey = 'FooBar';`).
If no `$resourceKey` is defined at the `Model`, the `ShortClassName` is used as key. For example, the `ShortClassName` of
the `App\Containers\AppSection\User\Models\User::class` is `User`.

### Error Responses formats {#error-response-formats}

Visit each feature, e.g. the Authentication, and there you will see how an unauthenticated response looks like, the same
for Authorization, Validation, and so on.
