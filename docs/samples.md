### The basic flow {#basic-flow}

When an HTTP request is received, it first hits your predefined Endpoint (each endpoint live in its own Route file).

### Sample Route Endpoint {#sample-route-endpoint}

```php
Route::get('hello', Controller::class);
```

After the user makes a request to the endpoint `[GET] www.api.apiato.com/v1/hello` it calls the defined controller 
function (`sayHello`).

### Sample Controller Function {#controller-function}

```php
class Controller extends ApiController
{
	public function sayHello(SayHelloRequest $request)
	{
            $helloMessage = app(SayHelloAction::class)->run();

            $this->json([
                $helloMessage
            ]);
	}
}
```

This function takes a Request class `SayHelloRequest` to automatically checks if the user has the right access to this 
endpoint. _Only if the user has access, it proceeds to the function body._

Then the function calls an Action (`SayHelloAction`) to perform the business logic.

### Sample Action {#sample-action}

```php
class SayHelloAction extends Action
{
	public function run()
	{
	    return 'Hello World!';
	}
}
```

The Action can do anything then return a result (could be an Object, a String or anything).

When the Action finishes its job, the controller function gets ready to build a response.

Json responses can be built using the helper function `json` (`$this->json(['foo' => 'bar']);`).

### Sample User Response {#sample-user-response}

```json
[
    "Hello World!"
]
```
