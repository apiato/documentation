## Your First Apiato Project {#your-first-apiato-project}

Before creating your first Apiato project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.
If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Apiato project via the Composer create-project command:
```
composer create-project apiato/apiato example-app
```

## Development Environment Setup {#Development-Environment}

You can run **Apiato** in any environment that you can run Laravel.

:::tip
Visit [Laravel Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/installation#laravel-and-docker) for more details.
:::

## Initial Configuration {#initial-configuration}

All the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the `config` directory
and all the configuration files for the Apiato framework are stored in the `app/Ship/Configs` directory.
Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

Apiato needs almost no additional configuration out of the box.
You are free to get started developing!
However, you may wish to review the `app/Ship/Configs/apiato.php` file and its documentation.
It contains several options that you may wish to change according to your application.

### Environment Based Configuration {#environment-based-configuration}

Since many of Apiato's configuration option values may vary
depending on whether your application is running on your local machine or on a production web server,
many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that exists at the root of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control,
since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration.
Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository,
since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

:::info
For more information about the `.env` file and environment based configuration,
check out the Laravel full [configuration documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/configuration).

### Databases & Migrations {#databases-and-migrations}

Now that you have created your Apiato application, you probably want to store some data in a database.
By default,
your application's `.env` configuration file specifies
that Apiato will be interacting with a MySQL database and will access the database at `127.0.0.1`.
If you are developing on macOS and need to install MySQL, Postgres,
or Redis locally, you may find it convenient to utilize `DBngin`.

If you do not want to install MySQL or Postgres on your local machine,
you can always use a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.
SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained database engine.
To get started, create a SQLite database by creating an empty SQLite file.
Typically, this file will exist within the database directory of your Apiato application:

```
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Next, update your `.env` configuration file to use Laravel's sqlite database driver. You may remove the other database configuration options:
```diff
+ DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
- DB_CONNECTION=mysql
- DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
- DB_PORT=3306
- DB_DATABASE=homestead
- DB_USERNAME=homestead
- DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

Once you have configured your SQLite database,
you may run your application's [database migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations),
which will create your application's database tables:

```
php artisan migrate
```

:::info Seed the Database
Apiato comes with a default (Super Admin) user and some default roles and permissions.
To seed the database with these default values, run the following command:
```
php artisan db:seed
```

Default user credentials:
- <span>email: {variables.defaults.admin.email}</span>
- <span>password: {variables.defaults.admin.password}</span>
:::
### Authentication Configuration {#authentication-configuration}

Visit [Authentication](../security/authentication.mdx) for more details.

### Directory Configuration {#directory-configuration}

Apiato should always be served out of the root of the "web directory" configured for your web server.
You should not attempt to serve a Apiato application out of a subdirectory of the "web directory".
Attempting to do so could expose sensitive files present within your application.


## Documentation Generation {#documentation-generation}

Install [ApiDocJs](https://apidocjs.com/) using NPM or your favorite dependency manager:
```
npm install
```

Then generate the API documentation:
```
php artisan apiato:apidoc
```

:::tip
Visit [Documentation Generator](../pacakges/documentation.md) for more details.

## Let's Play {#Play}

Now let's see it in action

Open your web browser and visit:

- https://apiato.test
  You should see an HTML page, with `Apiato` in the middle.
- https://api.apiato.test
  You should see a response like this:
```json
["Welcome to Apiato"]
```

Open your HTTP client and call:

https://api.apiato.test/ You should see a JSON response with the message: `"Welcome to apiato."`
https://api.apiato.test/v1 You should see a JSON response with the message: `"Welcome to Apiato (API V1)."`

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

Now that you have created your Apiato project, you may be wondering what to learn next.
If you're looking for a place to start, you should check out the following resources:
