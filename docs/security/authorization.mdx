Apiato provides a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through its Authorization Container.
Behind the scenes,
Apiato uses the [Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package.

:::info Default Roles & Permissions
Apiato comes with some default Roles and Permissions.
You can find them in `app/Containers/AppSection/Authorization/Data/Seeders`.
You can use them as a starting point, or delete them and create your own.
