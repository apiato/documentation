Apiato utilizes the [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport) package to provide a complete OAuth2 server.
While this guide focuses on the `Password Grant`, you can use any other grant type supported by Passport.

OAuth2 offers various methods of authentication, known as `grants`.
To learn how to choose the best grant type for your needs,
read [this](https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/authorization-server/which-grant/) article.

:::caution Important
This documentation assumes prior familiarity with OAuth2.
If you're new to OAuth2,
we recommend
acquainting yourself with its general [terminology](https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/terminology/) and features before proceeding.

:::tip
To access a comprehensive list of available Passport endpoints,
please refer to the `app/Containers/Authentication/UI/API/Routes/passport.v1.private.php` file.

## Installation

To get started, you should execute the `passport:install` Artisan command.
This command will create the encryption keys needed to generate secure access tokens.
In addition, the command will create "personal access"
and "password grant" clients which will be used to generate access tokens:

```
php artisan passport:install
```

You should see something like this:
```
Personal access client created successfully.
Client ID: 1
Client secret: Mo45lC2zhZWcMfDGmCbsw1OfasdCrc3wqQAeeYAO
Password grant client created successfully.
Client ID: 2
Client secret: nu8B2npfoR4hP6sWHaf90EvWUFe2EDYyJXGnCrso
```

Next you need to add the Password grant `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` to your `.env` file:
```dotenv
CLIENT_WEB_ID=2
CLIENT_WEB_SECRET=nu8B2npfoR4hP6sWHaf90EvWUFe2EDYyJXGnCrso
```

## Password Grant Tokens

The OAuth2 password grant allows your other first-party clients, such as a mobile application,
to obtain an access token using an email address / username and password.
This allows you to issue access tokens securely to your first-party clients
without requiring your users to go through the entire OAuth2 authorization code redirect flow.

### Creating A Password Grant Client

Before your application can issue tokens via the password grant, you will need to create a password grant client.
You may do this using the `passport:client` Artisan command with the `--password` option.
If you have already run the `passport:install` command, you do not need to run this command:

```
php artisan passport:client --password
```

### Access Token

<span><code>POST {variables.defaults.baseUrl.api}/oauth/token</code></span>
<div><br/></div>

Once you have created a password grant client,
you may request an access token
by issuing a `POST` request to the `/oauth/token` route with the user's email address and password.
If the request is successful,
you will receive an `access_token` and `refresh_token` in the JSON response from the server:

```json
// Request
{
  "grant_type": "password", // should always be "password"
  "client_id": "client-id", // required
  "client_secret": "client-secret", // required
  "username": "john@doe.com",
  "password": "secret",
  "scope": "" // can be empty
}
```

#### Proxy Endpoint

<span><code>POST {variables.defaults.baseUrl.api}/clients/web/login</code></span>
<div><br/></div>

By default, Apiato provides a single ready-to-use URL for your web client: `clients/web/login`.
However, you can add additional URLs as needed for each of your trusted first-party client apps.
For example, you could have URLs like `clients/mobile/login`.

You may request an access token
by issuing a `POST` request to the `/clients/web/login` route with the user's email address and password.
If the request is successful,
you will receive an `access_token` and `refresh_token` in the JSON response from the server:

```json
// Request
{
  "username": "john@doe.com",
  "password": "secret"
}
```
Behind the scenes, when a request is made to these endpoints,
the corresponding client ID and secret are automatically appended to the request.
This allows Apiato to make an additional call to your authentication server with all the necessary data.
This approach eliminates the need for clients to send their ID and secret with each request,
and it allows them to use their own URL, providing even more control over which client is accessing your server.
The authentication server then returns the authentication response to the client, including the tokens.

:::note
You must manually extract the client credentials from the database
and update your `.env` file with the appropriate credentials for each client.
:::

### Refresh Token

If your application utilizes short-lived access tokens,
users will need
to refresh their access tokens
using the refresh token that was provided to them when the access token was initially issued.

There are two recommended methods to refresh the token:

1. Proxy Endpoint (recommended for first-party clients):
 <span><code>POST {variables.defaults.baseUrl.api}/clients/web/refresh</code></span>

2. Proxy Endpoint (recommended for first-party clients):
 <span><code>POST {variables.defaults.baseUrl.api}/oauth/token</code></span>

#### Proxy Endpoint

<span>Apiato provides a default endpoint, <code>{variables.defaults.baseUrl.api}/clients/web/refresh</code>,
specifically for the Web Client to refresh its token.
You can create additional endpoints for each client as needed.
This endpoint can be used in two ways:
by manually passing the <code>refresh_token</code> to the endpoint or by including it in the request's <code>HttpCookie</code>.
In either case, the server will respond with a new access token and refresh token.</span>

#### Laravel Passport Endpoint

You can find more information about the Laravel Passport refresh token endpoint [here](https://laravel.com/docs/passport#refreshing-tokens).

### Revoking Tokens {#revoking-tokens}

<span><code>POST {variables.defaults.baseUrl.api}/api/logout</code></span>
<div><br/></div>

You may revoke a token by using this endpoint
and passing the token to be revoked in the header `Authorization: Bearer {token}`.

## Protecting Routes

#### API
To protect an API endpoint from being accessible by unauthenticated users, you can use the `auth:api` middleware.

```php
Route::get('secret/info', Controller::class)
    ->middleware('auth:api');
```

All endpoints protected with the `auth:api` middleware can only be accessed
by sending a valid access token along with the request.
This ensures that only authenticated users with valid tokens are granted access to these endpoints.

#### Web

To secure a web endpoint and restrict access to authenticated users only, you can utilize the `auth:web` middleware.
By applying the `auth:web` middleware to a specific endpoint or route,
you ensure that only authenticated users can access it.
This middleware verifies the user's authentication status based on their web session or cookie,
making it suitable for web-based authentication and authorization.

```php
Route::get('private/page', Controller::class)
    ->middleware('auth:web');
```

### Passing The Access Token

When calling routes that Passport protects,
your application's API consumers should specify their access token as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header of their request.
For example, when using the Guzzle HTTP library:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

$response = Http::withHeaders([
    'Accept' => 'application/json',
    'Authorization' => 'Bearer '.$accessToken,
])->get('http://api.apiato.test/v1/users');

return $response->json();
```

## Configuration

Most of the configuration is done in the `app/Containers/AppSection/Configs/appSection-authentication.php` file.
