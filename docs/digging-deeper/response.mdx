The `Apiato\Support\Facades\Response` facade is a powerful tool to create API responses.
It extends `Spatie\Fractal\Fractal` and enhances its functionality by
adding methods for resource key management, meta-information, and standardized HTTP responses.

Here are some examples of how to use the `Response` facade:

```php
Response::create($user)->transformWith(UserTransformer::class)->json(null, 200);

Response::create()->transformWith(UserTransformer::class)->ok($user);

Response::create($user, UserTransformer::class)->created();

Response::create($user, UserTransformer::class)->parseIncludes(['permissions'])->toArray();

Response::ok();
```
