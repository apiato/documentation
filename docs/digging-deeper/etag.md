The **ETag** or **entity tag** is part of HTTP, the protocol for the World Wide Web.
It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for Web cache validation,
which allows a client to make conditional requests.

You can read more about this feature in the [Requests](../components/main-components/requests.md#etag) documentation.
