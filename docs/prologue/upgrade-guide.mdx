#### Upgrading Laravel to 11.0 from 10.x
Follow the official [Laravel 11 upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/upgrade) to update your codebase accordingly.

#### Upgrading Apiato to 13.0 from 12.x and Core to 13.0 from 8.x
This guide will walk you through upgrading Apiato and your project to the latest versions.

## Upgrade Utilities

### Legacy Bridge
The [Legacy Bridge](https://github.com/apiato/legacy-bridge) is a set of utilities
to help you gradually upgrade your codebase.

### Rector Rules
Apiato provides a set of [custom Rector rules](https://github.com/mohammad-alavi/apiato-rector)
to help automate some aspects of the upgrade process.

## Updating Dependencies

### PHP 8.2.0 Required
PHP 8.2.0 or greater is now required.

### Composer Dependencies
Perform these steps to update your dependencies.

#### Remove First-Party Apiato Packages
Delete all Apiato first-party packages in `app/Containers/Vendor` to avoid dependency conflicts.
These packages will be reinstalled after running `composer update`.

#### Consolidate Dependencies
If the following dependencies are defined in the Ship or any Container `composer.json` file,
move them to your application’s root `composer.json` file:
- `apiato/core`
- `laravel/passport`
- `spatie/laravel-permission`

#### Update Dependency Versions
Update the following dependencies in your `composer.json` files:

require
  - `apiato/core` to `^13.0`
  - `laravel/passport` to `^12.0`
  - `spatie/laravel-permission` to `^6.0`
  - `apiato/documentation-generator-container` to `^4.0`

[//]: # (  - `apiato/localization` to `^3.0` &#40;if installed&#41; TODO)
[//]: # (  - `apiato/social-auth` to `^4.0` &#40;if installed&#41; TODO)

require-dev
  - `nunomaduro/collision` to `^8.1`
  - `phpunit/phpunit` to `^11.0`
  - `barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper` to `^3.0`
  - `vimeo/psalm` to `^6.0`
     Don’t forget to also update `psalm` plugins if you have them:
     ```json
     "psalm/plugin-laravel": "^3.0",
     "psalm/plugin-mockery": "^1.2",
     "psalm/plugin-phpunit": "^0.19.2",
     ```

#### Remove Unnecessary Dependencies
Remove these dependencies from your root `composer.json` file:

`spatie/laravel-ignition`  (Laravel now provides its own error page)

Following dependencies are also no longer required as they are now either managed by `apiato/core` or Laravel Framework itself.

PHP extensions
- `ext-curl`
- `ext-gettext`
- `ext-mbstring`
- `ext-openssl`
- `ext-pdo`
- `ext-sodium`
- `ext-tokenizer`

Packages
- `guzzlehttp/guzzle`
- `laravel/framework`
- `laravel/tinker`

#### Review Package Upgrade Guides
Check the upgrade guides for each dependency to be aware of additional breaking changes:
- [phpunit/phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/11.0.0/ChangeLog-11.0.md#1100---2024-02-02)
- [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/upgrading)

Remove the existing `vendor` directory for a clean start:
```bash
rm -rf vendor
```
Pull in the latest dependencies:
```bash
composer update
```
Because of the merging behavior of `wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin`,
run the command a second time to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed:
```bash
composer update
```

## Abstract Namespace
The Core abstract classes have been relocated from `Apiato\Core\Abstracts` to `Apiato\Core`.

Update your codebase to use this new namespace.

## App Configuration
Laravel 11 and Apiato 13 configurations are simplified, and both now provide a fluid API for configuration.

Replace the contents of `bootstrap/app.php` file with the following as a base, and customize it as needed:

```php
<?php

use Apiato\Foundation\Apiato;
use Apiato\Http\Middleware\ProcessETag;
use Apiato\Http\Middleware\ValidateJsonContent;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

$basePath = dirname(__DIR__);
$apiato = Apiato::configure(basePath: $basePath)->create();

return Application::configure(basePath: $basePath)
    ->withProviders($apiato->providers())
    ->withEvents($apiato->events())
    ->withRouting(
        web: $apiato->webRoutes(),
        channels: __DIR__ . '/../app/Ship/Broadcasts/channels.php',
        health: '/up',
        then: static fn () => $apiato->registerApiRoutes(),
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        // Previously applied via app/Ship/Kernels/HttpKernel class
        $middleware->api(append: [
            ValidateJsonContent::class,
            ProcessETag::class,
        ]);

        // Uncomment and adjust these if using web routes:
        // $middleware->redirectUsersTo(fn ($request): string => action(HomePageController::class));
        // $middleware->redirectGuestsTo(fn ($request): string => action([LoginController::class, 'showForm']));
    })
    ->withCommands($apiato->commands())
    ->withExceptions(static function (Exceptions $exceptions) {})
    ->create();
```

Move any custom middleware registrations from `app/Ship/Kernels/HttpKernel.php` to the `bootstrap/app.php` file.

Move any custom configurations from `app/Ship/Kernels/ConsoleKernel.php` and `App\Ship\Kernels\HttpKernel` to the `bootstrap/app.php` file.

Remove `App\Ship\Kernels\HttpKernel` and `App\Ship\Kernels\ConsoleKernel` classes.

## Testing

#### `TestCase` Class
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Tests\PhpUnit\TestCase` class namespace has changed to `Apiato\Core\Testing\TestCase`.

#### `LazilyRefreshDatabase` Trait
The `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\LazilyRefreshDatabase` trait has been removed from the Core TestCase.

Add `LazilyRefreshDatabase` to your `App\Ship\Parents\Tests\TestCase` if you want this functionality.

#### Removed Methods
The testing utilities provided by Apiato have been simplified to embrace Laravel’s testing approach.

The following methods are no longer available:
- `getTestingUser`
- `getTestingUserWithoutAccess`
- `makeCall`
- `injectId`
- `endpoint`
- `getAuth`
- `setResponseObjectAndContent`
- `getResponseContentArray`
- `getResponseContent`
- `setResponseContent`
- `getResponseContentObject`
- `auth`
- `url`
- etc...

:::tip
For a gradual upgrade in large codebases, refer to the [Apiato Legacy Bridge](#upgrade-utilities).
:::

[HasResourceKeyTrait](#has-resource-key-trait) has been removed from the Core Value Object (`Apiato\Core\Values\Value`).

If your Value Objects are relying on the `HasResourceKeyTrait`,
you need to refactor them to use the new [HasResourceKey](#has-resource-key-trait) trait
and implement the [ResourceKeyAware](#has-resource-key-interface) interface.

## Service Providers
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Providers\MainServiceProvider` class has been removed.

Existing service providers extending this class should be refactored
to extend `Apiato\Core\Providers\ServiceProvider` class instead.
e.g, `App\Ship\Parents\Providers\ServiceProvider` class.

### Automatic Registration
All providers within the `Providers` directories of Containers and Ship are now automatically registered.
There is no longer a requirement to have a specifically named `MainServiceProvider` service provider per container.

:::note
Any parent providers under `app/Ship/Parents/Providers` will **NOT** be registered automatically.
If you need to do something in a provider’s `register` or `boot` methods,
extend those providers in a Container or Ship `Providers` directory.
:::

### Specific Provider Changes

#### AuthServiceProvider
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Providers\AuthServiceProvider` class has been removed.

- If you were manually registering policies outside Laravel’s policy discovery, follow the [Laravel manual registration guide](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/authorization#manually-registering-policies).
- Refactor all service providers extending the following service providers to extend `App\Ship\Parents\Providers\ServiceProvider`:
  - `App\Ship\Parents\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`
  - `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`
  - `Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`
- Move any custom registrations from `App\Ship\Parents\Providers\AuthServiceProvider` to another service provider and then remove it.

#### MiddlewareServiceProvider
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Providers\MiddlewareServiceProvider` class has been removed.

Migrate your middleware configurations
to the `bootstrap/app.php` file as per [Laravel’s middleware registration documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/middleware#registering-middleware).
Then, remove your old `MiddlewareServiceProvider` classes.

Let's
say you have customized Laravel's `Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated` middleware
and registered it in your `MiddlewareServiceProvider`:

```php
class MiddlewareServiceProvider extends ParentMiddlewareServiceProvider
{
    protected array $middlewareAliases = [
        'guest' => RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
    ];
}
```

You can now configure it in `bootstrap/app.php` like this:
```php
return Application::configure(basePath: $basePath)
    ...
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        $middleware->api(
            replace: [
                'guest' => RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
            ]
        );
    ...
    ->create();
```

#### BroadcastServiceProvider
- Removed: `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Providers\BroadcastServiceProvider`
- Action:
Remove your custom `App\Ship\Parents\Providers\BroadcastServiceProvider` and configure channels in `bootstrap/app.php`
as shown [above](#app-configuration).

### Parent Method Calls
You no longer need to call `parent::register()` or `parent::boot()` in your service providers.
All service providers’ `register` and `boot` methods are now invoked independently.

### Removed Properties
The `$serviceProviders` and `$aliases` properties have been removed.
Refactor your service providers to register or alias dependencies within the `register` and `boot` methods.

```php
// before
public array $serviceProviders = [
    ThirdPartyServiceProvider::class,
];

public array $aliases = [
    'something' => ThirdPartyServiceProvider::class,
];

// after
public function register(): void
{
    // Reminder: providers under Containers or Ship are autoloaded
    // and don't need to be registered manually.
    $this->app->register(ThirdPartyServiceProvider::class);
    $this->app->alias(ThirdPartyServiceProvider::class, 'something');
}
```

## Middleware
The following classes have been moved or renamed:
| From | To |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Middlewares`                                    | `Apiato\Core\Middleware`                     |
| `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Middlewares\Http\ProcessETagHeadersMiddleware`  | `Apiato\Http\Middleware\ProcessETag`         |
| `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Middlewares\Http\ValidateJsonContent`           | `Apiato\Http\Middleware\ValidateJsonContent` |

The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Middlewares\Http\ProfilerMiddleware` class has been removed.

The `Apiato\Core\Middleware\Http\Authenticate` class has been removed.
Use `Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate` instead.

Custom middleware like `ProcessETag` and `ValidateJsonContent` must now be registered in the `bootstrap/app.php` file.
Take a look at the [App Configuration](#app-configuration) section for details.

## Resource Key
If you have custom models that don't extend the `App\Ship\Parents\Models` models,
you need to implement the `Apiato\Http\Resources\ResourceKeyAware` interface
and use the `Apiato\Http\Resources\HasResourceKey` trait.
e.g., `App\Containers\AppSection\Authorization\Models\Roles`.

#### `HasResourceKey` Interface {#has-resource-key-interface}
The `Apiato\Core\Contracts\HasResourceKey` interface has been renamed
and moved to `Apiato\Http\Resources\ResourceKeyAware`.

#### `HasResourceKey` Trait {#has-resource-key-trait}
The `Apiato\Core\Traits\HasResourceKeyTrait` trait has been renamed
and moved to `Apiato\Http\Resources\HasResourceKey`.

## ModelTrait
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Traits\ModelTrait` trait has been renamed
and moved to `Apiato\Core\Models\InteractsWithApiato`.

## Value Objects
`Apiato\Core\Values\Value` abstract class is now declared as `readonly`.

Add the `readonly` keyword to your parent Value Object class and all Value Objects that extend it.

## Models
Models `$resourceKey` property is no longer used.

If you were customizing the resource key in your models, you can now do so by overriding the `getResourceKey` method.

## Laravel Passport

### Migration Adjustments
Passport 12.0 no longer loads its own migrations automatically.

Copy Passport migrations from the [Apiato 13.x branch](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/tree/13.x/app/Containers/AppSection/Authentication/Data/Migrations) into your application
(create the `Data/Migrations` directory if it doesn’t exist).

### Password Grant
As of Passport 12.0, the password grant is disabled by default.

Enable it by calling `enablePasswordGrant` in the `boot` method of one of your service providers:

```php
public function boot(): void
{
    Passport::enablePasswordGrant();
}
```

### Deferrable Provider
Remove the `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\DeferrableProvider` from the service provider that configures Passport.

For example
```php
// before
use App\Ship\Parents\Providers\ServiceProvider as ParentAuthServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\DeferrableProvider;
use Laravel\Passport\Passport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ParentAuthServiceProvider implements DeferrableProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Passport::enablePasswordGrant();
    }
}

// after
use App\Ship\Parents\Providers\ServiceProvider as ParentAuthServiceProvider;
use Laravel\Passport\Passport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ParentAuthServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Passport::enablePasswordGrant();
    }
}
```

## Carbon 3
In Carbon v3, PHPDoc annotations have been converted to real types. Methods that previously accepted different argument types may now throw a `TypeError`.

For instance, this example will now throw an error if `config('apiato.api.expires-in')` returns a string:

```php
Passport::tokensExpireIn(Carbon::now()->addMinutes(config('apiato.api.expires-in')));
```

To fix it, explicitly cast the string to an integer:

```php
Passport::tokensExpireIn(Carbon::now()->addMinutes((int)config('apiato.api.expires-in')));
```

:::info
Review Carbon’s [release notes](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/releases/tag/3.0.0) and [documentation](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-carbon-3) for more details.
:::

## Request

### Removed Methods
The following methods have been removed from requests:
- `injectData`
- `withUrlParameters`
- `getAccessArray`
- `getDecodeArray`
- `getUrlParametersArray`
- `hasAccess`
- `hasAnyPermissionAccess`
- `hasAnyRoleAccess`
- `check`
- `mapInput`
- `getInputByKey`

:::tip Gradual Upgrade
For a gradual upgrade in large codebases, refer to the [Apiato Legacy Bridge](#upgrade-utilities).
:::

### Authorization
Custom authorization features have been removed and `$access` property is no longer used.

- Use [Laravel Policies](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/authorization#creating-policies) for authorization.
- Remove the `$access` property from your request classes.

- `hasAccess`
- `hasAnyPermissionAccess`
- `hasAnyRoleAccess`
- `check`

#### Example Conversion:
```php
// before
use App\Ship\Parents\Requests\Request as ParentRequest;

final class DeleteUserRequest extends ParentRequest
{
    protected array $access = [
        'permissions' => 'delete',
        'roles' => '',
    ];

    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return $this->check(['hasAccess']);
    }
}

// after
use App\Containers\AppSection\User\Models\User;
use App\Ship\Parents\Requests\Request as ParentRequest;

final class DeleteUserRequest extends ParentRequest
{
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return $this->user()->can('delete', [User::class]);
    }
}
```

### URL Parameter Validation
The `$urlParameters` property and the `getUrlParametersArray` method have been removed.
URL parameters are no longer available for validation in the `rules` method.

- Remove the validations that are based on the URL parameters.
- Remove any reference to the `$urlParameters` property.
- Remove calls to `getUrlParametersArray`.

:::note
Note that invalid URL parameters now result in a 404 error rather than a 422 error.
:::

### Hashed ID Decoding
In addition to the previous behavior, the `$decode` property can now decode route parameters.
The catch is that the decoded route parameters will not be available via `input` or `all` methods.
Instead, you can access them via `route` method.

```php
// endpoint
/users/{id}

class DemoRequest extends ParentRequest
{
    protected array $decode = ['id'];
}

$id = $request->route('id');
```

### Input Sanitization
`sanitizeInput` has been renamed to `sanitize`.

## Error Handling
All Apiato custom error-handling logics has been removed.

### Removed Methods on Exceptions
- `debug`
- `withErrors`
- `getErrors`

### ExceptionsHandler
The custom `App\Ship\Exceptions\Handlers\ExceptionsHandler` is no longer used.

Remove this class and configure exception handling in `bootstrap/app.php` file.

### HTTP vs. Non-HTTP Exceptions
Exceptions are now divided into two groups: **HTTP Exceptions** and **Non-HTTP Exceptions**.

Create a parent HTTP exception class in `app/Ship/Parents/Exceptions/HttpException.php`:

```php
namespace App\Ship\Parents\Exceptions;

use Apiato\Core\Exceptions\HttpException as AbstractException;

abstract class HttpException extends AbstractException {}
```

You now have two parent classes: `Exception` (non-HTTP) and `HttpException` (HTTP).

Update your custom exceptions:
- Extend `App\Ship\Parents\Exceptions\HttpException` for HTTP errors.
- Extend `App\Ship\Parents\Exceptions\Exception` for non-HTTP errors.

### Exception Instantiation
Exceptions now require mandatory constructor parameters.
For example, calling `new NotFoundHttpException()` with no arguments no longer works.
You have to pass the `$message` and the `$code` arguments.

Refactor your exception instantiations accordingly.

:::tip Automated Refactoring
See [Rector Rules](#rector-rules) for automated refactoring utilities.
:::

### Removed Core Exceptions
All exceptions under the `Apiato\Core\Exceptions` namespace have been removed.

Remove their usages from your application.
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\AuthenticationException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\GeneratorErrorException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\IncorrectIdException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\InvalidTransformerException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\MissingJSONHeaderException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\MissingTestEndpointException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\UndefinedMethodException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\UnsupportedFractalIncludeException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\WrongConfigurationsException`
- `Apiato\Core\Exceptions\WrongEndpointFormatException`

:::note
Apiato now returns `401` instead of `403` when a user is unauthenticated (matching Laravel’s default behavior).
:::

## Response

### Transformation
The `transform` method in API Controllers is removed.
Use the [Response](../the-basics/response.mdx) facade instead.

Update your `app/Ship/Configs/fractal.php` file to use the Apiato Response class
```php
'fractal_class' => \Apiato\Http\Response::class
```

Replace all `$this->transform` calls with the Response facade.
```php
// before
return $this->transform($data, Transformer::class);

// after
return Response::create($data, Transformer::class);
```

:::tip Automate this process using Rector
See [Upgrade Utilities](#upgrade-utilities) for automated refactoring utilities.
:::

### Filtering
The approach to filtering responses has changed.
Check out its [documentation](../the-basics/response.mdx#filtering) and update your code accordingly.

## Repository
Some repository methods are strongly typed or behave differently.

#### `boot` Method
`boot` now has a `void` return type.

If you have overridden the `boot` method, adjust your method signature accordingly.

#### `getById` Method
`getById` has been renamed to `findOrFail`.

#### `delete` Method
`delete` method now returns `bool` or throws an exception.

If you have overridden the `delete` method, adjust your method signature accordingly.

#### `create` Method
`create` now throws `Apiato\Core\Repositories\Exceptions\ResourceCreationFailed` instead of `\Exception`.

#### `update` Method
`update` now throws `Apiato\Core\Repositories\Exceptions\ResourceNotFound` instead of `\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ModelNotFoundException`.

#### `find` Method
`find` now returns `null` if no result is found (mirroring Laravel’s default `find` behavior). Previously, it might have thrown an exception.

:::info Maintaining Previous Behavior
To maintain the previous behavior of the `find`, `create`, and `update` methods,
use the [Legacy Bridge](#upgrade-utilities).
:::

### Criteria
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Criterias` class has been moved to `Apiato\Core\Criteria`.

## Hash IDs
`Apiato\Core\Traits\HashIdTrait` is removed.

Previously, you could use `$this->decode(...)` and `$this->encode(...)` methods in the Controller and Request classes
to decode and encode hash IDs.
Now, you need to use the `hashids` helper function instead.

Use the `hashids()` helper function instead.
- `$this->decode(...)` → `hashids()->decode(...)`
- `$this->encode(...)` → `hashids()->encode(...)`
- `Hashids::decode(...)` → `hashids()->decode(...)`
- `Hashids::encode(...)` → `hashids()->encode(...)`
- etc...

:::warning
`decode` method now returns an `int` or an `array` depending on the input.
Previously, it always returned an `array`.
:::

## Jobs
The Core Job class (`Apiato\Core\Jobs\Job`) no longer includes any traits or implements interfaces.

Add the necessary traits and interfaces in your Ship’s parent Job class. For example:
```php
namespace App\Ship\Parents\Jobs;

use Apiato\Core\Jobs\Job as AbstractJob;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Queue\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

abstract class Job extends AbstractJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue;
    use Queueable;
    use SerializesModels;
}
```

## Validation
The custom `no_spaces` validation rule has been removed.

Remove its usage or register it manually in the boot method of your service provider.

See the [source code](https://github.com/apiato/core/blob/8.x/src/Traits/ValidationTrait.php) for reference.

## Database Seeding
Apiato no longer uses Laravel’s `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`. Instead, place your seeders in the Ship or any Container’s `database/seeders` directory:

- Remove `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` if present.
- Move your seeding logic into `Ship` or `Container` seeder classes.

The `apiato:seed-deploy` and `apiato:seed-test` commands have been moved from the `Core` to the `Apiato`.
So they will be only available in new Apiato projects.

To use them in your existing project, either:
- Create your own custom command to seed your database.
- Or copy the `apiato:seed-deploy` and `apiato:seed-test` commands from the [Apiato 13.x branch](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/tree/13.x/app/Ship/Commands) into your application.
  - Remember to also copy the `app/Ship/Seeders` [directory](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/tree/13.x/app/Ship/Seeders).

## Commands
The `Apiato\Core\Abstracts\Commands\ConsoleCommand` class has been renamed
and moved to `Apiato\Core\Console\Command`.

## Notifications
The `notification.channels` configuration has been removed.

You can no longer add a notification channel to all notifications
by adding it to the `notification.channels` array in the configuration file.

```php
abstract class Notification extends LaravelNotification
{
    // This method has been removed from the parent class
    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return config('notification.channels');
    }
}
```

If you depend on this feature, you can add the removed method to your parent notification class.

## API URL Configuration

### Path Prefix
The `apiato.api.prefix` configuration option has been removed.

You can now configure the path prefix
using the [Apiato configuration](../digging-deeper/advance-configuration.mdx#routing).

### Version Prefix
The `apiato.api.enable_version_prefix` configuration option has been removed.

You can now configure the version prefix
using the [Apiato configuration](../digging-deeper/advance-configuration.mdx#routing).

## Miscellaneous
We recommend
reviewing changes in [apiato/apiato](https://github.com/apiato/apiato) and [apiato/core](https://github.com/apiato/core) repositories between versions [12.x and 13.x](https://github.com/apiato/apiato/compare/12.x...13.x) and [8.x and 13.x](https://github.com/apiato/core/compare/8.x...13.x) respectively,
using GitHub’s comparison tools.
Not all changes are mandatory.
Some involve configuration or comments you may wish to sync.
