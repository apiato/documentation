Apiato uses the [Porto](https://github.com/Mahmoudz/Porto) Software Architectural Pattern
to structure the application code.

Investing 30 minutes in reading the [Porto Documentation](https://github.com/Mahmoudz/Porto) before getting started is highly recommended and can prove to be a
valuable use of your time.
The document serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for understanding the Apiato project.
