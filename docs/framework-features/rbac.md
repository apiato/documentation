Apiato provides a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through its Authorization Container.
Behind the scenes,
Apiato uses the [Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package.

You can read more about this feature in the [Authorization](../security/authorization.mdx) documentation.
